# Coding Standards

* At work, they can be really bad. Especially if you don't work in a development shop.

* Something you write could live 10+ years.

* You could make an interns life 5 years from now less painful, even for yourself when you come back to the code to add a new feature 3, 6, or 9 months after you delivered it.
--

* Generally, there are 4 simple things you can do to make things easier
--

  * Use a linter
  * Advocate for Python 3.6+ and use Types
  * Force type checking for your code with Mypy
  * Write realistic and .make-important[easy] tests*

.footnote[*Having to manually setup a full env to run each test is a non-starter]
--

All this isn't always possible, but try.

???

Talk about story of adding in a feature to framework that everyone was avoiding, ended up being under 10 lines

---
# Linting

* Warn you when code doesn't comply to a specified format
* Many linters: flake8, pep8, pylint, pyflakes, etc...
  * We'll use flake8 / Mypy for this class

--

What's wrong with this code?

```python
def main():
   a = 1
   b = 2
   print(a)
   print(c)
def add(one, two):
     return one + two
def addd(one: int, two: int) -> int:
    """Adds two integers and returns the result"""
    return	one + two
add(1, 2)
add("one", "two")
addd(1, 2)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Typing

The authors of Python have indicated that Python will remain a dynamically typed language, and will never force type hints.
* However, PEP 484 introduced Type Hints, making "Large Python" not a death defying experience

* Types in Python are always optional. With or without them, your code will run.

* Sometimes it _may_ be too cumbersome to Type everything (just don't be lazy)

* However, Types enable rich documentation and autocomplete using any IDE.

---
# Typing Overview

.left-column[
```python
import typing
# For simple types, just use the name of the type
x: int = 1
x: float = 1.0
x: bool = True
x: str = "test"
x: bytes = b"test"

# (Python 3.9+)
x: list[int] = [1]
x: set[int] = {6, 7}

# In Python 3.8 and earlier
x: List[int] = [1]
x: Set[int] = {6, 7}
x: Dict[str, float] = {'field': 2.0}
```
]
.right-column[
Types:
 * int, str, list, set, dict, bytes, etc...
 * List, Set, Dict, Tuple, Optional
 * Callable, Iterator, Union, Optional
 * Mapping, MutableMapping, Sequence, Iterable
]

???

Python has support for optional "type hints".

These "type hints" are a special syntax that allow declaring the type of a variable.

By declaring types for your variables, editors and tools can give you better support.

---
# Typing

* Open up a new python file is your VSCode (Ensure Python/Pylance are installed)
* Write up the following two functions

```python
def add(one, two):
    return one + two


def addd(one: int, two: int) -> int:
    """Adds two integers and returns the result"""
    return one + two
```

--

* Now, try to use both functions.

  * Note how VSCode is able to add additional context

--

* Try using _addd_ like `addd("one", 2)` 

---

# Mypy

Mypy is by far the most popular Python static type checker. Three important things about it:
1. Is optional.
  * Doesn't spew errors on code you haven't added types for
2. Does not catch runtime errors.
  * Raise warnings before running. Doesn't enforce during execution.
3. Does not speed up the program.
  * Research is ongoing to speed up Python with known types ahead of time. During execution, they are ignored.

--

Other notable type checkers
 * Pyright (microsoft) -- built in to pylance
 * Pyre (Facebook)
 * Pytype (Google)
 * [Type hint cheatsheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

???

Typing is so important, that these companies paid full time developers (within the company) to implement typing capabilities in Python

---
# Mypy

Lets look at Mypy from out example before
```python
def add(one, two):
    return one + two


def addd(one: int, two: int) -> int:
    """Adds two integers and returns the result"""
    return one + two


add(1, 2)
add("one", "two")
addd(1, 2)
addd("one", "two")
```

```terminal
$ mypy linting.py 
linting.py:13: error: Argument 1 to "addd" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
linting.py:13: error: Argument 2 to "addd" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

---
# Mypy

But I write perfect code!
--

* You don't  

--

But this is just for me!
--

* What if your code / thing / widget / framework is successful?

--

* You think you're really going to go back and re-write/annotate/comment 100's/1000's of lines of code?

--

Sometimes it is alright to ignore all this, but think hard about it.

---
# Exceptions

Some languages, errors are specified through return values (Golang, C).  
Other languages, think Java/Python, issues are raised through the use of exceptions. 

--

  * When dealing with the real world (Files, Networks, OS, etc...), you must be aware of errors
  * Programming defensively means your program shouldn't blow up if an error occurs
  * Failing to recover or save state to resume later can cause serious damage

In Python, the syntax is:
```python
try: 
  code
except ExceptionType as variable:
  code
```

---
# Exceptions
.left-column-wide[
```terminal
def throw_stuff():
  selection = input("0, 1, or 2? ")
  exceptions = [ValueError, RuntimeError, ReferenceError]
  raise exceptions[int(selection)]("Message here...")

def catch_stuff():
  try:
    throw_stuff()
  except ValueError as e:
    print("There was a value error {}".format(e))
  except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Runtime error this time {}".format(e))
  except ReferenceError as e:
    print("Reference error now fool! {}".format(e))
  except Exception as e:
    print("Some other exception dude {}".format(e))
  except BaseException as e:
    print("Oooh!  We fell all the way back {}".format(e))
  print("Still did this...")

```
]
.right-column-small[
- Let's consider raising exceptions...
- We'll define two functions:
1. throw_stuff raises exceptions:
    - Based on user input...
    - What if user input is not in the expected format
2. catch_stuff calls throw_stuff:
    - The programmer wanted to handle throw_stuff's exceptions
    - Programmer caught all exceptions...
]

---

# Custom Exceptions

.left-column-wide[
```python
class MyException(Exception):
  pass

class NumberNotInRangeError(Exception):
  """Exception raised for errors in the input number.

  Attributes:
    number -- input number which caused the error
    message -- explanation of the error
  """

  def __init__(self, number, message="Number is not in (100, 200) range"):
      self.number = number
      self.message = message
      super().__init__(self.message)

>>> raise MyException("No Comment")
...
__main__.MyException: No Comment
>>> raise NumberNotInRangeError(1000)
...
__main__.NumberNotInRangeError: Number is not in (100, 200) range

```
]
.right-column-small[
 * To create a custom exception, just inherit from Exception
]

# Testing

For this class we'll be using the pytest module.  
Lot of different modules exist. Doesn't really matter what you use.  

--

It is good practice to write independent test programs first (Test Driven Development - TDD)
  * This never really happens
  * It can happen if you have a clearly defined end goal (aka payment API/tasking API/etc...)

--

Useful to:  
* Ensure that new code doesn't break existing code (regressions).  
* Quickly triage what broke.
* Code matches expected functionality.
* Unit Testing/Functional Testing/Integration testing

---

# Pytest - Unit Test

* Note: If a file isn't specified, pytest looks for all files/dirs that start with _test_ and functions inside those files that start with _test_

```python
# test_capitalize.py

def capital_case(x):
    return x.capitalize()

def test_capital_case():
    assert capital_case('semaphore') == 'Semaphore'

## Short Exercise & Review

Take a look at _wallet.py_ and implement additional tests in _test_wallet.py_  
 * There is an issue in _wallet.py_ 
 
   * Can you have negative money? (No IOUs here!)
 * Located in Day3 folder  
 * Feel free to use a linter / types where you think they fit

# Exercise

The exercise for this section is .make-important[standards].

# Lunch / Review

# Logging

Python includes the .make-important[logging] package in the stdlib to make your life easy. It is common and you will see it during your experience.

* Simplest usage:

.left-column[
```terminal
>>> import logging
>>> logging.warning('Watch out!')
WARNING:root:Watch out!

>>> logging.info('I told you so')

>>> 
```
]
.right-column[
* Default config prints warnings and higher
* Default logging levels:

  * debug
  * info
  * warning
  * error
]

---

# Logging vs Print Debugging

* Can specify an output format that is invisible down to road
* You can pass around the logger object
 * Do your config in the beginning and functionality implemented later doesn't need to worry about it
* Your logger can specify multiple output streams
 * Send output to the console and to a file
* During production, set the loglevel to _INFO_ so only info, warn, and error message print
* During development, set loglevel to _DEBUG_ so everything prints out
 * No need to worry about commenting out debug prints. i.e. `print(x, y, z, ...)`

---

# Logging

```terminal
>>> logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.DEBUG)
>>> logging.debug('This message should go to the log file')
>>> logging.info('So should this')
>>> logging.warning('And this, too')
>>> logging.error('And non-ASCII stuff, too, like Øresund and Malmö')

>>> quit()

$ cat example.log

DEBUG:root:This message should go to the log file
INFO:root:So should this
WARNING:root:And this, too
ERROR:root:And non-ASCII stuff, too, like Øresund and Malmö
```

---

# Logging

```terminal
# app.py
import logging
import lib

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO)
    logging.info('Started')
    lib.do_something()
    logging.info('Finished')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# lib.py
import logging

def do_something():
    logging.info('Doing something')
```

```terminal
$ cat app.log
INFO:root:Started
INFO:root:Doing something
INFO:root:Finished
```
???
If your program consists of multiple modules, here’s an example of how you could organize logging in it:

If you run app.py, you should see this in app.log:

which is hopefully what you were expecting to see. You can generalize this to multiple modules, using the pattern in lib.py.

---

# Useful Logging

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('example') # create logger
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
ch = logging.StreamHandler() # create console handler
fh = logging.FileHandler(filename="example.log")
ch.setLevel(logging.INFO) #Print out important messages to the console
fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) #We don't want the user / operator / analyst to see all the messages

formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') # create formatter
 
ch.setFormatter(formatter) # add formatter to ch
logger.addHandler(ch) # add ch to logger
fh.setFormatter(formatter) # add formatter to fh
logger.addHandler(fh) # add fh to logger

# code
logger.debug('debug message')
logger.info('info message')
logger.warning('warn message')
logger.error('error message')
logger.critical('critical message')
```

---
# Useful Logging

```terminal
$ python advanced_logging_example.py

2021-05-03 15:10:26,620 - example - INFO - info message
2021-05-03 15:10:26,695 - example - WARNING - warn message

# JSON Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

In Python, the _dict_ type is very close to resembling json.

```javaScript
{
  "menu": {  
    "id": "file",  
    "value": "File",  
    "popup": {  
      "menuitem": [  
        {"value": "New", "text": "Create a Document"},  
        {"value": "Open", "onclick": "Open a File"},  
        {"value": "Save", "onclick": "Save the Document"}  
      ]  
    }  
  }
}  
```

# JSON Example

```terminal
>>> import json
>>> json.dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}]) #json.dumps(obj)
'["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'

>>> print(json.dumps("\"foo\bar")) #json.dumps(obj)
"\"foo\bar"

>>> print(json.dumps('\u1234')) #json.dumps(obj)
"\u1234"

>>> print(json.dumps('\\')) #json.dumps(obj)
"\\"

>>> print(json.dumps({"c": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0}, sort_keys=True)) #json.dumps(obj)
{"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}

>>> from io import StringIO
>>> io = StringIO()
>>> json.dump(['streaming API'], io) #json.dump(obj, file)
>>> io.getvalue() 
'["streaming API"]'
```

# Bytes & Bytearrays

Python3 introduced the following sequence of 8-bit integers:
* bytes - immutable, like a tuple
* bytearray - mutable, like a list

--

```terminal
>>> blist = [1, 2, 3, 255]
>>> the_bytes = bytes(blist)
>>> the_bytes
b'\x01\x02\x03\xff'

>>> the_byte_array = bytearray(blist)
>>> the_byte_array
bytearray(b'\x01\x02\x03\xff')
```

--

You've seen it before, but how do we declare a string and how to we declare bytes using the string syntax?

--

```terminal
>>> "Hello!"
'Hello!'
>>> b'\x61'
b'a'
```

---
# Bytes & Bytearrays

```terminal
>>> blist = [1, 2, 3, 255]
>>> the_bytes = bytes(blist)
>>> the_bytes[1] = 127
```

Does this work?

--

```terminal
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'bytes' object does not support item assignment
```

---
# Bytes & Bytearrays

```terminal
>>> blist = [1, 2, 3, 255]
>>> the_byte_array = bytearray(blist)
>>> the_byte_array
bytearray(b'\x01\x02\x03\xff')
>>> the_byte_array[1] = 127
```

Does this work?

--

```terminal
>>> the_byte_array
bytearray(b'\x01\x7f\x03\xff')
```

## Strings to Bytes and Back Again

```terminal
>>> my_str = "We need to write to a file!"
>>> f = open("test.txt", "wb")
>>> f.write(my_str)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'

Happens all the time - :(
```
---
## Strings to Bytes and Back Again

```terminal
>>> my_str = "We need to write to a file!"
>>> f = open("test.txt", "wb")
>>> my_str.encode() #What encoding is it defaulting to?
b'We need to write to a file!'

>>> f.write(my_str.encode())
```
--

```terminal
# Another common issue
>>> b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "strict")  
```

--

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 0:
  invalid start byte
```

--

```terminal
>>> b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "replace")
'\ufffdabc'
>>> b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "backslashreplace")
'\\x80abc'
>>> b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "ignore")
'abc'
```

Python defaults to UTF-8

UTF-8 has several convenient properties:

It can handle any Unicode code point.

A Unicode string is turned into a sequence of bytes that contains embedded zero bytes only where they represent the null character (U+0000). This means that UTF-8 strings can be processed by C functions such as strcpy() and sent through protocols that can’t handle zero bytes for anything other than end-of-string markers.

A string of ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text.

UTF-8 is fairly compact; the majority of commonly used characters can be represented with one or two bytes.

If bytes are corrupted or lost, it’s possible to determine the start of the next UTF-8-encoded code point and resynchronize. It’s also unlikely that random 8-bit data will look like valid UTF-8.

UTF-8 is a byte oriented encoding. The encoding specifies that each character is represented by a specific sequence of one or more bytes. This avoids the byte-ordering issues that can occur with integer and word oriented encodings, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, where the sequence of bytes varies depending on the hardware on which the string was encoded.

# Dealing with Odd Data

# Structs

Python has multiple tools for dealing with data. Up until now, tools for binary data were few and far between.  The Python library provides the .make-important[struct] standard library to convert binary data to Python data structures.

The two important methods:
* struct.pack - converting python data to binary
* struct.unpack - converting binary data to Python

---

# Struct in Practice

```python
>>> import struct

>>> big_int = struct.pack('>I', 2015) # Convert 2015 to Big Endian Integer
>>> big_int
b'\x00\x00\x07\xdf'

>>> little_int = struct.pack('<I', 2015) # Convert 2015 to Big Endian Integer
>>> little_int
b'\xdf\x07\x00\x00'

>>> struct.unpack(">I", big_int)
(2015,)

>>> struct.unpack("<I", big_int)
(3741777920,)

# What is an Endianness?

* Endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory.
* It is primarily expressed as:

  * big-endian (BE)
  * little-endian (LE)
* You can find different endianness for ARM, MIPS
* x86/64 is always little endian

---

# What is an Endianness?

Big-endian - stores the most significant byte in the smallest memory address. Ex: `0xffeeddcc` at `0x1000`.  
```terminal
0x1000 - 0xff  
0x1001 - 0xee  
0x1002 - 0xdd  
0x1003 - 0xcc  
4 byte view  
0x1000 - 0xffeeddcc  
```

--
  
   
Little-endian - stores the most significant byte in the highest memory address. Ex: `0xffeeddcc` at `0x1000`.  
```terminal
0x1000 - 0xcc  
0x1001 - 0xdd  
0x1002 - 0xee  
0x1003 - 0xff  
4 byte view  
0x1000 - 0xccddeeff  
```

The type specifiers follow the endian character. Any specifier may be preceded by a number that indicates the count; 5B is the same as BBBBB.

You can use a count prefix instead of >LL:

Use big-endian integer format (>)

Skip 16 bytes (16x)

Read eight bytes—two unsigned long integers (2L)

Skip the final six bytes (6x)

# Why Would You Use This?

* Sending data over a network
  * You can use a standardized format that is interoperable
  * Other language can interpret the byte sequences
  * No room for interpreting data

* File formats
  * Be explicit with how data is stored on disk
  * Again, leave no room for error.

* Reading/Writing in a binary format is typically easier in code for computers
  * No string parsing!
