Beginner: Use the blackjack template to implement a basic game of blackjack. If run as a script, the game should have a player and dealer. It should display the players and dealers cards in accordance with the rules. It should take input from the user on whether they want to “hit” or “pass”. Once the user has finished, it should draw additional cards for the dealer when required then determine whether the player won or dealer won.

Intermediate: Make it so the game can have multiple players. Allow the players to be human controlled or follow some sort of pre-defined “strategy”.

Expert: Create a webui using flask, django, or fastapi to allow the user to see the cards and make a decision from their browser.
